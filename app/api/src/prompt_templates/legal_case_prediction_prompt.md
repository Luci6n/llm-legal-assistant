## Legal Case Outcome Analysis

### Case Scenario Summary
This case involves a tenancy dispute over a serviced apartment unit in Perak. The Plaintiff, Ruslan bin Ramli, purchased the unit from the 1st Defendant (Segi Objektif (M) Sdn Bhd) and later entered into a tenancy agreement with the 2nd Defendant (Bukit Merah Resort Sdn Bhd). The tenancy expired on 1.4.2007, but the Defendants failed to return possession and continued occupying the premises without rent until 8.12.2010. The Plaintiff sought compensation for unlawful holding over and double rental under the Civil Law Act 1956.

### Key Legal Issues
- Civil appeal filed against a Klang Sessions Court summary judgment.
- Sessions Court had awarded the Plaintiff RM250,000.00 plus RM360.00 per day for continued occupation after tenancy expiry.
- Vacant possession delivered only after more than three years of overstay.
- Defendants’ affidavit was struck out for late filing.
- Plaintiff invoked Section 28(4)(a) Civil Law Act 1956 for double rental.
- Court noted Defendants’ delay tactics in pursuing the appeal.
- *Inferred point:* The prolonged occupation without rent strongly weakened the Defendants’ position.

### Predicted Outcome
**Disposition:** Plaintiff wins
**Judgment Type:** Appeal Dismissed

**Remedy:**
- **Damages Awarded:**
  - Type: Compensatory
  - Amount: RM478,960.00
  - Currency: MYR
- **Injunction:** false
- **Declaratory Relief:** false
- **Specific Performance:** false
- **Costs Awarded:** Plaintiff
