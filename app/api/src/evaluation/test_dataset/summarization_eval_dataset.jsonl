The applications sought to quash a compensation award issued by the Land Administrator on 15.12.2022 concerning the acquisition of part of Lot 1774, Mukim 09, Daerah Seberang Perai Selatan, Penang, for a bridge upgrading project. The Applicant contended that the Land Administrator failed to comply with Section 34 of the Land Acquisition Act 1960 (LAA) by not referring the issue of acquiring the whole building (due to total impairment) to the High Court and by not awarding compensation for the building and structures. The court found that the Land was subject to an implied condition for \"Agricultural\" use under Sections 53 and 115 of the National Land Code (NLC). The buildings on the land (Proton Sales and Service Centers, Truck Workshops) were deemed illegally constructed as they violated this land use category. Citing Paragraph 1(3A) of the First Schedule of the LAA and relevant precedents, the court ruled that the value of illegally constructed buildings must be disregarded for compensation. Consequently, Section 34 of the LAA, which pertains to the acquisition of part of a building, was held to apply only to legally constructed buildings.
