An agreement is defined as every promise and every set of promises forming the consideration for each other.\n\n2. **Free Consent**: The consent of the parties to the agreement must be free and not obtained by coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake (see section 14 of the Contracts Act 1950, though not directly quoted in the retrieved text).\n\n3. **Competency of Parties**: The parties entering into the contract must be competent to contract. Generally, this means they must be of sound mind and have attained the age of majority (see section 11 of the Contracts Act 1950, not directly quoted here).\n\n4. **Lawful Consideration and Lawful Object**: The agreement must be made for a lawful consideration and with a",

The maxim \"non haec in foedera veni\" (\"It was not this that I promised to do\") applies ([2], para 23).\n   - The change must be so significant that the obligation, if performed, would be fundamentally different from what was contracted.\n\n3. **Elements Identified by Malaysian Courts**:\n   - In Guan Aik Moh (KL) Sdn Bhd & Anor v Selangor Properties Bhd [2007], Gopal Sri Ram HMR outlined three elements:\n     1.",

Section 18 defines \"misrepresentation\" as including:\n\n- (a) The positive assertion, in a manner not warranted by the information of the person making it, of that which is not true, though he believes it to be true;\n- (b) Any breach of duty which, without an intent to deceive, gives an advantage to the person committing it by misleading another to his prejudice; and\n- (c) Causing, however innocently, a party to an agreement to make a mistake as to the substance of the thing which is the subject of the agreement.\n\nThe retrieved context does not explicitly mention silence as misrepresentation within section 18 itself.\n\n### 2.

It references section 18 of the Contracts Act 1950 and mentions relevant case law principles. However, it does not fully address whether silence can amount to misrepresentation, as it fails to discuss exceptions (such as duty to disclose or half-truths) or cite any case law directly on silence as misrepresentation. The references to the retrieved context are present but not explicitly linked to the issue of silence. | Strengths: Schema compliance is strong; statutory and case law structure is clear; disclaimer is present; references to retrieved context are included. | Weaknesses: Completeness is lacking as the answer does not directly address the main query about silence as misrepresentation or discuss exceptions; relevance is partial; support from the context is not clearly tied to the specific issue of silence."

Statutory Remedies\n\n**a) Damages (Compensation)**\n- The primary remedy for breach of contract is the award of damages, which are monetary compensation intended to place the non-breaching party in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed.\n- Section 76 of the Contracts Act 1950 (Act 136) states:  \n  \"A person who rightly rescinds a contract is entitled to compensation for any damage which he has sustained through the non-fulfilment of the contract.\"\n- The principle is compensatory, not punitive: damages are generally not awarded for distress or loss of reputation (see case law below).\n\n**b) Rescission**\n- The innocent party may elect to rescind (terminate) the contract, thereby releasing both parties from further obligations.\n- Upon rescission, compensation may still be claimed for losses suffered due to non-performance (see Section 76, Contracts Act 1950).\n\n**c) Specific Performance**\n- In",

It covers the main statutory remedies (damages, rescission, specific performance) and references Section 76 of the Contracts Act 1950. It also cites relevant case law on the compensatory nature of damages. However, the section on specific performance is incomplete, and not all possible remedies (such as injunctions or quantum meruit) are discussed. References to the retrieved context are present but could be more explicitly linked. | Strengths: Clear schema compliance, accurate statutory references, relevant case law cited, and direct answer to the query. | Weaknesses: Incomplete discussion of all available remedies (e.g., specific performance section is cut off, no mention of injunctions or quantum meruit), and references to retrieved documents could be more explicitly connected to each finding."

Real legal cases involve complex factors including specific evidence, argumentation, judicial discretion, and procedural rules not captured here. This is purely an analytical exercise based on limited data. Consult a qualified Malaysian legal professional for advice on any specific legal matter.\n\n---\n\n**Definition of \"Duty of Care\" in Negligence Claims by the Malaysian Judiciary:**\n\nBased on the provided legal case extracts, the Malaysian judiciary has defined and discussed \"duty of care\" in negligence claims as follows:\n\n### 1. Foundational Principles\n\n- The concept of \"duty of care\" is central to actionable negligence, which requires three essential elements:\n  - The existence of a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff.\n  - A breach of that duty.\n  - Damage suffered by the person to whom the duty was owed.\n\n  > \"Actionable negligence may be said to possess three essential ingredients: the complex concept of duty, breach of the duty; and damage suffered by the person to whom the duty was owing.\"  \n  (Source: Legal case extract)\n\n### 2. Judicial Formulation (Neighbour Principle)\n\n- The Malaysian courts have referenced Lord Atkin’s formulation from *Donoghue v Stevenson*, which has been influential in defining the duty of care:\n  > \"...there must be, and is, some general",

Consult a qualified Malaysian legal professional for advice on any specific legal matter.\n\n---\n\n**Legal Research Synthesis: Compensation for Psychiatric Injury (Nervous Shock) under Malaysian Tort Law**\n\n**1. General Principle of Damages in Tort**\n- Malaysian tort law recognizes compensation for personal injuries caused by a wrongful act, as established in cases such as *Ong Ah Long v Dr. S. Underwood [1983] 2 MLJ 324* and *Ku Jia Shiuen & Anor v Kerajaan Malaysia & Ors [2013] 4 MLJ 108*. The courts have held that damages are compensatory in nature and intended to provide reparation for all natural and direct consequences of the wrongful act, \"so far as money can compensate\" ([Ong Ah Long], [Ku Jia Shiuen]).\n\n**2. Nature of Compensable Injuries**\n- The term \"personal injuries\" in Malaysian tort law is interpreted broadly to include both physical and psychiatric harm, provided that the injury is a natural and direct consequence of the defendant's wrongful act.\n\n**3.

It addresses the general compensability of psychiatric injury under Malaysian tort law and references relevant case law. However, it does not explicitly cite or directly link its findings to the specific retrieved documents, and the discussion of statutes is missing. The answer is generally relevant but lacks direct support from the provided context. | Strengths: Schema compliance (disclaimer + findings), clear structure, general relevance to the query, references to Malaysian case law. | Weaknesses: No explicit references to the retrieved documents, no statutory analysis, and insufficient linkage between findings and the provided context.

It is **NOT** legal advice and **DOES NOT** constitute a definitive prediction of the actual court outcome. Real legal cases involve complex factors including specific evidence, argumentation, judicial discretion, and procedural rules not captured here. This is purely an analytical exercise based on limited data. **Consult a qualified Malaysian legal professional for advice on any specific legal matter.**\n\n---\n\n### Indefeasibility of Title under the National Land Code 1965 (NLC)\n\n#### Statutory Provisions\n\n- **Section 340 of the National Land Code 1965 (NLC)** is the principal provision governing indefeasibility of title in Peninsular Malaysia. While the full text of Section 340 was not included in the retrieved context, case law and references confirm its centrality.\n\n- The concept is also reflected in provisions for Penang and Malacca titles, where \"indefeasibility\" is addressed after certain administrative processes (see e.g., National Land Code (Penang and Malacca Titles), sections 82–89).\n\n#### Meaning and Operation\n\n- **Indefeasibility of title** means that once a person is registered as proprietor of land, their title to that land is secure and cannot generally be challenged or set aside except in certain circumstances expressly provided by law.\n\n- The NLC provides that upon registration, the proprietor obtains an indefeasible title, subject to exceptions.\n\n####",

Consult a qualified Malaysian legal professional for advice on any specific legal matter.\n\n---\n\n### Treatment of Adverse Possession in Malaysian Courts\n\n#### Statutory Framework\n\n- The National Land Code (NLC) governs land matters in Malaysia. According to the retrieved case Kabra Holdings Sdn Bhd v Ahmad Bin Shahlan & Ors [1992] 2 CLJ 609 (High Court), the court stated:\n  > \"In Malaysia there is no concept of 'adverse possession' which entitles the user or occupant to assert any legal or equitable rights. ... Adverse possession regardless of the period can never give the defendants the right to occupy the disputed land pursuant to Sections 48 and 341 of the National Land Code.\"\n\n#### Judicial Precedent\n\n- Malaysian courts have consistently held that adverse possession does not confer title or rights over land, regardless of how long a person has occupied it.\n- The High Court in Kabra Holdings Sdn Bhd explicitly rejected adverse possession as a basis for acquiring rights to land.\n- This position is reinforced by Section 341 of the NLC, which provides that \"the title of any person",

However, the completeness and support are lacking: the findings reference a specific case and statute, but there is no clear linkage to the retrieved documents, which do not appear to address unlawful eviction or related remedies. The answer partially covers the main legal principles but does not fully ground them in the provided context. | Strengths: Schema compliance is strong; the answer is well-structured and references both statutory and case law remedies. The disclaimer is clear and appropriately placed. | Weaknesses: Completeness is limited by lack of direct support from the retrieved documents. The findings are not clearly linked to the provided context, and the references to statutes and cases appear to be based on external knowledge rather than the retrieved material.

This is purely an analytical exercise based on limited data. Consult a qualified Malaysian legal professional for advice on any specific legal matter.\n\n---\n\n## Directors' Personal Liability for Company Debts in Malaysia\n\n### General Principle: Separate Legal Entity\n\nMalaysian law generally upholds the principle that a company is a separate legal entity from its directors and shareholders (see, e.g., BUMIPUTRA-COMMERCE BANK BERHAD v AUGUSTO POMPEO ROMEI & ANOR [2014] 6 CLJ 17; PEOPLE'S INSURANCE Co (M) SDN BHD V PEOPLE'S INSURANCE CO LTD & ORS [1986] 1 MLJ 68). This means that, ordinarily, directors are not personally liable for the debts of the company.\n\n### Exceptions: Circumstances of Personal Liability\n\nHowever, there are specific circumstances under which directors can be held personally liable for company debts:\n\n#### 1. **Statutory Breaches and Offences**\n- Directors may be personally liable if they breach statutory duties under the Companies Act 2016 or other relevant legislation. For example, failure to maintain proper accounting records can result in personal liability",

The relevant provisions are found in Part III, Division 8 of the Act.\n\n#### Grounds for Winding Up by Court\nSection 465 of the Companies Act 2016 provides the grounds upon which a company may be wound up by the court, including:\n- The company has by special resolution resolved that it be wound up by the court.\n- The company is unable to pay its debts.\n- Other grounds such as failure to commence business, having no members, or directors acting against members' interests (see [JA-28NCC-178-07/2019]).\n\n#### Inability to Pay Debts\nA key ground for winding up due to insolvency is that the company is \"unable to pay its debts.\" The law recognizes both practical and theoretical tests for insolvency:\n- **",

It also references a relevant case (JA-28NCC-178-07/2019) and retrieved context.

Statutory Provisions\n\n**Section 88 of the Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976** (as referenced in case law and legislative extracts):\n\n- The court has the power to make orders regarding the custody of children when granting a decree of divorce or judicial separation.\n- **Paramount Consideration:** The welfare of the child is the paramount consideration in deciding custody (see also: case reference ONG HUI LIAN -V- RICHARD LAU CHON HAO).\n- The court may consider:\n  - The wishes of the parents.\n  - The wishes of the child, if old enough to express an independent opinion.\n  - The conduct of the parties.\n  - Any other circumstances the court thinks relevant.\n\n**",

It is NOT legal advice and DOES NOT constitute a definitive prediction of the actual court outcome. Real legal cases involve complex factors including specific evidence, argumentation, judicial discretion, and procedural rules not captured here.

However, in Malaysian law, the primary section governing penalty clauses is Section 75 of the Contracts Act 1950, which specifically addresses compensation for breach where a sum is named in the contract as payable upon such breach (i.e., liquidated damages or penalty clauses).\n\n**2. Judicial Interpretation (from Retrieved Cases)**\n- The Federal Court in **Cubic Electronics Sdn Bhd (In Liquidation) v Mars Telecommunications Sdn Bhd** (as referenced in the retrieved context) has clarified the approach to penalty clauses under Section 75:\n    - The party seeking to enforce a damages clause must prove: (a) there was a breach; and (b) the contract contains a clause specifying a sum to be paid upon breach.\n    - Once these are established, the innocent party is",

The main issue was whether there was a clear, legally binding extension of the contract for the seventh time. The court reviewed the trial records, the Sessions Judge's grounds of judgment, and submissions from both parties.\n\nThe Sessions Judge found that meeting minutes explicitly referred to discussions and agreement on a proposed seventh extension of the contract for BFWA services for the C4i System with Comintel. The court noted that despite notification from the Plaintiff about removing their equipment, they did not actually do so, which indicated ongoing performance under the contract. This conduct, coupled with documented meeting agreements, led the court to conclude that a binding seventh extension had indeed occurred.\n\nThe High Court affirmed this reasoning, emphasizing that clear documentary evidence and subsequent conduct by both parties supported the existence of a valid contract extension. The appeal was considered on these grounds, focusing on whether such conduct and documentation sufficed to create legal obligations for another term.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n• Main issue: Whether a seventh contractual extension existed between parties.\n• Sessions Judge relied on meeting minutes explicitly mentioning and agreeing to a seventh extension.\n• Plaintiff did not remove its equipment after announcing intent to do so, indicating continued performance.\n• Court found that both documentary evidence and conduct showed mutual agreement to extend.\n• High Court agreed",

Gerry, a key individual involved in the e-portal's creation, also filed a counterclaim for emotional distress. The court, after an 18-day trial, found that despite work commencing on the e-portal, no formal, signed JV agreement ever came into existence due to conflicting evidence, inconsistencies in witness testimonies (particularly from Ramesh, Chaks, and Gerry), and the failure of any party to produce a signed agreement. The court drew an adverse inference against the defendants for not calling a material witness. Consequently, all claims and counterclaims, being premised on the existence of a JV agreement, were dismissed.",

The Defendants raised several defenses: premature claim by Plaintiff, alleged unjust enrichment due to double charging, defective formwork supplied, and inaccuracies in accounts.\n\nThe Court analyzed whether these defenses raised triable issues that would prevent summary judgment. After reviewing documentary evidence—including correspondence and payment records—the Court found no serious triable issues warranting a full trial.

The court also dismissed the Applicants' argument regarding the seniority of the Sessions Court Judge, noting that the relevant circular (Pekeliling Ketua Pendaftar Bilangan 1 Tahun 2013) had been revoked. Finally, the court found that the Applicants failed to demonstrate that the Temerloh Sessions Court was an inconvenient forum, as they could not show that hearing the case there would cause undue problems for parties or witnesses. Consequently, the application for transfer was rejected.",

Central to the dispute are whether the Applicant should be afforded a right to be heard prior to termination and whether principles applicable to public servants extend to this situation. The Applicant cited authorities such as ABDUL GHANI CHE MAT v. PENGERUSI SURUHANJAYA PASUKAN POLIS & ORS [2017] 3 CLJ 399 and KHAIRUL AZIZI MAT SAAD v. TAN SRI ABDUL HAMID BADOR & ORS [2024] 1 CLJ 1, which involve police officers classified as public servants under Article 132(1) of the Federal Constitution. However, the Court distinguished these precedents, noting that the Applicant is not a public servant, thus rendering those legal principles inapplicable. The Court’s analysis on these issues was closely tied to previous discussions regarding the Applicant’s actual standing within the Fourth Respondent and reiterated that procedural protections for public officers do not automatically apply in this context.\n\nKey Points\n• The case concerns the Applicant’s status and rights within the Fourth Respondent.\n• Main issue: whether the Applicant should be given a right to be heard before termination.\n• Authorities cited by Applicant involved public servants",

The Plaintiff provided evidence of registered trademarks, sales invoices in Malaysia (2011-2020) to establish goodwill, and a trap purchase revealing infringing products. The Defendant raised a preliminary objection regarding the delay in filing the application, which the Court overruled due to the Covid-19 pandemic and international logistics. The Defendant also argued that its products were dissimilar, it had no knowledge of infringement, and raised several triable issues, including the authenticity of the trap purchase and the lack of goodwill in Malaysia. The Court, after physical examination of the products and review of evidence, found that the Defendant's products bore marks identical or nearly resembling the Plaintiff's, causing confusion. It also found that the Plaintiff had established goodwill and that the Defendant's use of the Plaintiff's address on the product constituted misrepresentation.

          "reference_summary": "This document details the Grounds of Judgement for a summary judgment application filed by the Plaintiff, Tramontina S/A Cutelaria, against the Defendant, Giant Ace Sdn Bhd, for trademark infringement and passing off. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant sold machetes bearing marks identical or confusingly similar to the Plaintiff's registered trademarks in Malaysia and Brazil. The Plaintiff provided evidence of registered trademarks, sales invoices in Malaysia (2011-2020) to establish goodwill, and a trap purchase revealing infringing products. The Defendant raised a preliminary objection regarding the delay in filing the application, which the Court overruled due to the Covid-19 pandemic and international logistics. The Defendant also argued that its products were dissimilar, it had no knowledge of infringement, and raised several triable issues, including the authenticity of the trap purchase and the lack of goodwill in Malaysia. The Court, after physical examination of the products and review of evidence, found that the Defendant's products bore marks identical or nearly resembling the Plaintiff's, causing confusion. It also found that the Plaintiff had established goodwill and that the Defendant's use of the Plaintiff's address on the product constituted misrepresentation. The Court concluded that the Defendant's alleged triable issues were mere bare assertions unsupported by evidence, thus granting summary judgment in favour of the Plaintiff for trademark infringement and passing off.",

The dispute arose from TS's non-payment of interim payments to HJ, its sub-contractor, for a construction project. An adjudicator, Peter Leong Peng Chiew, had previously ordered TS to pay HJ RM867,837.88 plus costs. TS contended that the adjudicator denied it natural justice by taking a restrictive view of his jurisdiction, failing to inform parties of procedures, not considering TS's defence, and denying a trial. HJ argued that the adjudicator conducted proceedings fairly and within jurisdiction. The High Court upheld a preliminary objection by HJ, discarding TS's further affidavits filed out of time. The court found that adjudication proceedings are not akin to civil litigation, and parties are obliged to submit all supporting documents upfront. TS's adjudication response was deemed \"bald and shoddy\" and devoid of supporting documents. The court clarified that the adjudicator's powers under s. 25 of CIPAA are discretionary, not mandatory, and TS's argument of \"justice rushed is no justice at all\" was without merit, attributing the problem to TS's own inexpert conduct.

          "reference_summary": "This case involves two cross-applications heard together: Originating Summons No. WA-24C-218-10/2019 (OS 1) filed by TANY SERVICES SDN BHD (TS) to set aside an adjudication decision, and Originating Summons No. WA-24C-241-11/2019 (OS 2) filed by HAMZAH JAAFAR (P) SDN BHD (HJ) to enforce the same adjudication decision. The dispute arose from TS's non-payment of interim payments to HJ, its sub-contractor, for a construction project. An adjudicator, Peter Leong Peng Chiew, had previously ordered TS to pay HJ RM867,837.88 plus costs. TS contended that the adjudicator denied it natural justice by taking a restrictive view of his jurisdiction, failing to inform parties of procedures, not considering TS's defence, and denying a trial. HJ argued that the adjudicator conducted proceedings fairly and within jurisdiction. The High Court upheld a preliminary objection by HJ, discarding TS's further affidavits filed out of time. The court found that adjudication proceedings are not akin to civil litigation, and parties are obliged to submit all supporting documents upfront. TS's adjudication response was deemed \"bald and shoddy\" and devoid of supporting documents. The court clarified that the adjudicator's powers under s. 25 of CIPAA are discretionary, not mandatory, and TS's argument of \"justice rushed is no justice at all\" was without merit, attributing the problem to TS's own inexpert conduct. Consequently, the court dismissed OS 1 and allowed OS 2, ordering TS to pay costs.",

The Plaintiff had purchased the property and paid the full purchase price, with the transaction involving redemption of a prior loan and the removal of earlier caveats. The Defendant, a lender to the previous owner (vendor), lodged its caveat as security for repayment of a loan after the vendor failed to repay the Defendant following the sale of the property to the Plaintiff.\n\nThe Court examined whether the Defendant’s caveat was lodged in bad faith and whether it should remain on the property. The Court found that the Defendant’s caveat was not lodged in bad faith, as it was based on a legitimate loan agreement with the vendor. However, the Plaintiff, having completed the purchase and paid the full price, had a superior interest in the property. The Court cited established case law, emphasizing that once a purchaser has paid in full and the transfer is complete, subsequent caveats by third parties (such as lenders to the previous owner) cannot override the purchaser’s rights.

Correctness is poor: the model output does not match the ground truth outcome (case dismissed, no damages, costs to defendant). Plausibility is moderate, as the summary and issues are reasonable, but the lack of a clear, legally sound outcome prediction reduces reliability."
