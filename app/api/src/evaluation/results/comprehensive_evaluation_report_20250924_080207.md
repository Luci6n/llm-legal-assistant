#### Sample Research Outputs

**Item 1**

*Question*: What are the requirements for a valid contract under the Malaysian Contracts Act 1950?

*Answer*: This analysis is based solely on the limited facts provided and the retrieved legal documents. It is NOT legal advice and DOES NOT constitute a definitive prediction of the actual court outcome. Real legal cases involve complex factors including specific evidence, argumentation, judicial discretion,...

*LLM Judge*: 4.0/5.0 - Reasoning: Reasoning: The response follows the required schema with a clear disclaimer and structured findings. It covers the main statutory requirements for a valid contract under the Malaysian Contracts Act 1950 and references the retrieved context. However, while it mentions case law, it does not fully elaborate on the principles from the cited cases, and some references are not directly quoted or explicitly linked to the findings. | Strengths: Clear disclaimer; structured presentation of statutory requirements; references to relevant sections of the Contracts Act 1950; some linkage to retrieved case law. | Weaknesses: Does not fully integrate or explain the case law principles from the retrieved context (e.g., Smith v. Hughes on objective assent); some statutory references are noted as 'not directly quoted'; could improve explicit linkage between findings and specific retrieved documents.

**Item 2**

*Question*: How have Malaysian courts applied the doctrine of frustration in contract cases?

*Answer*: Based on the provided legal documents, Malaysian courts have applied the doctrine of frustration in contract cases with careful adherence to established principles, as follows:

1. **Narrow Application and Historical Roots**:
   - The doctrine of frustration is not lightly invoked to relieve parties...

*LLM Judge*: 3.0/5.0 - Reasoning: Reasoning: The response does not include a disclaimer in the first paragraph, which is required by the schema. The findings are structured and reference both statutes and case law, and the main legal principles from the retrieved context are covered. References are present but could be more explicitly linked to the provided documents. The answer is relevant and mostly complete, but the lack of a disclaimer and incomplete referencing reduce the score. | Strengths: Findings are well-structured, cover both statutory and case law principles, and address the main legal tests and elements of frustration as applied by Malaysian courts. | Weaknesses: Missing required disclaimer in the first paragraph; references to sources are not always clearly or fully linked to the provided context; the answer is cut off and incomplete in the last point.

#### Sample Summarization Outputs

**Item 1**

*Case Facts*: Summarize the case 12A-983-2010 from Mahkamah Tinggi into the following format: 1. Summarized Document (~200–300 words). 2. Key Points (bullet list of important details).

*Summary*: Here is the summarized case as requested:

---

**1. Summarized Document (~200–300 words)**

The case of Ruslan Bin Ramli v. Segi Objektif (M) Sdn Bhd & Bukit Merah Resort Sdn Bhd (12A-983-2010, Mahkamah Tinggi) concerns a dispute over the possession and rental of an apartment unit at Bukit Merah La...

*LLM Judge*: 4.0/5.0 - Reasoning: Reasoning: The model output complies with the required schema, providing both a summarized document and key points. The summary is clear and generally faithful to the case facts, covering the dispute over possession, the tenancy agreement, the period of unlawful occupation, and the court's decision in favor of the plaintiff. However, it omits some key details from the reference summary, such as the specific monetary award (RM250,000.00 and RM360.00 per day), the fact that this was an appeal from a Sessions Court summary judgment, and the High Court's comments on the Defendants' delay and lack of merit in their defense. | Missing: Specific monetary awards, reference to the Sessions Court summary judgment, details about the appeal process and the Defendants' delay, and explicit mention of the High Court upholding the lower court's decision. | Improvements: Include the exact amounts awarded (RM250,000.00 and RM360.00 per day), clarify that the case was an appeal from a Sessions Court summary judgment, mention the High Court's observations on the Defendants' delay and lack of merit in their defense, and state that the High Court upheld the Sessions Court's judgment.

**Item 2**

*Case Facts*: Summarize the case AA-A52NCvC-210-12/2019 from Mahkamah Sesyen into the following format: 1. Summarized Document (~200–300 words). 2. Key Points (bullet list of important details).

*Summary*: Here is the summary of the case AA-A52NCvC-210-12/2019 from Mahkamah Sesyen, as provided by the Legal Summarization Agent:

---

**Summarized Document**

In AA-A52NCvC-210-12/2019 before the Sessions Court in Ipoh, the Plaintiffs (Ong Yeong and Lim Wei Chet) sued Manhattan Management Sdn. Bhd. (1st ...

*LLM Judge*: 3.0/5.0 - Reasoning: Reasoning: The model output includes both required sections (schema compliance), and the summary is generally clear and readable. However, it is incomplete and partially unfaithful: it omits key procedural details (the applications Enclosure 47 and 49), the court's reasoning on estoppel, the plaintiffs' continued collection of rent, and the dismissal of the amendment application. The summary also cuts off mid-sentence, further reducing completeness and clarity. | Missing: Details about Enclosure 47 and 49, the court's findings on estoppel, the plaintiffs' continued rent collection, the dismissal of the amendment application, and the court's reasoning for rejecting mesne profits. | Improvements: Include the procedural context (the two applications), summarize the court's reasoning on estoppel and the plaintiffs' actions, mention the dismissal of the amendment application and its reasoning, and ensure the summary is complete and not cut off mid-sentence.

#### Sample Prediction Outputs

**Item 1**

*Case Facts*: A civil appeal arose before the Shah Alam High Court concerning a dispute over a serviced apartment unit. Segi Objektif (M) Sdn Bhd and Bukit Merah Resort Sdn Bhd filed an appeal against Ruslan bin Ra...

*Prediction*: Unknown

*LLM Judge*: 2.0/5.0 - Reasoning: Reasoning: Schema compliance is partial: the Disclaimer, Case Scenario Summary, and Key Legal Issues sections are present, but the Predicted Outcome section is incomplete and lacks key details (disposition, judgment type, remedy). Correctness is poor: the model does not state the actual outcome (plaintiff wins, appeal dismissed, damages awarded), nor does it mention the compensatory damages or costs. Plausibility is moderate: the issues identified are relevant, but the absence of a clear prediction makes it hard to assess legal reasoning. Overall, the output is incomplete and does not match the ground truth.

**Item 2**

*Case Facts*: A tenancy dispute unfolded between landlords and their tenant, involving subletting arrangements. The landlords, Ong Yeong and Lim Wei Chet, had entered into a principal tenancy agreement with Manhatt...

*Prediction*: Unknown

*LLM Judge*: 2.0/5.0 - Reasoning: Reasoning: Schema compliance is partial: the Disclaimer, Case Scenario Summary, and Key Legal Issues sections are present, but the Predicted Outcome section is incomplete and lacks detail (disposition and judgment type are marked 'Unknown', and no remedy is specified). Correctness is poor: the model does not match the ground truth outcome (case dismissed, summary judgment, no damages, costs to defendant). Plausibility is not fully assessable due to the incomplete prediction, but the partial analysis is reasonable. Overall, the output is incomplete and does not provide a clear or correct prediction.
