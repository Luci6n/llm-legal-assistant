Scenario 1 – Restaurant fines on staff

A restaurant in Kuala Lumpur became widely discussed after employees revealed that the management enforced an extensive system of monetary penalties. Workers reported that they were fined RM100 whenever they took medically certified sick leave, and RM200 if they were caught using their phone during working hours. Breakages of items were also penalised, with RM100 deducted for a broken spoon and RM200 for a broken bowl. Staff were even fined for using the toilet during peak business hours, and in some cases as much as RM500 was imposed for certain customer reviews or service issues.

In another widely shared list, lateness was punished on a sliding scale, starting from RM60 for being late by five minutes, RM130 for ten minutes, RM250 for thirty minutes, and reaching up to RM600 for being one hour late. These fines were not occasional but were systematically applied through deductions from the employees’ monthly wages, creating significant financial pressure and widespread criticism once the list was circulated publicly.

Scenario 2 – Sitiawan KFC Volvo crash

On the night of May 8, 2025, at about 9:05 pm, a serious accident occurred at a busy traffic light junction along Jalan Sitiawan–Lumut in Sitiawan, Perak. A Volvo XC90 driven by a 29-year-old man reportedly lost control as it approached the junction, veered to the right, and crashed directly into a KFC outlet located at the roadside. The impact was severe: one 73-year-old woman was killed in the incident, while seven other individuals, including a child, sustained injuries of varying degrees.

Eyewitnesses and CCTV footage captured the chaotic aftermath, with customers and staff inside the restaurant caught off guard as the vehicle smashed through the premises. The collision caused significant property damage to the building and forced emergency services to respond immediately. The driver was detained by police at the scene for further investigation into the cause of the accident. The case received widespread media coverage due to the scale of casualties and the shocking nature of a vehicle crashing into a popular fast-food restaurant.

Scenario 3 – Mamak restaurant parking lot crash

One night at a commercial area in Malaysia, several people were eating at a mamak restaurant when an accident occurred in the parking lot outside. A silver Toyota Hilux driven by an intoxicated individual lost control and crashed into multiple parked cars. Among the vehicles struck was a black Perodua belonging to a diner who was inside the restaurant at the time with friends.

The impact pushed the black car into other vehicles, causing a chain collision. Photos taken after the incident show the Hilux mounted onto the curb with significant frontal damage, while the Perodua sustained heavy side and rear damage, with its chassis reportedly bent. Police at the scene confirmed the Hilux driver was drunk. The owner of the black Perodua was informed that his car may be considered a total loss due to the structural damage.
